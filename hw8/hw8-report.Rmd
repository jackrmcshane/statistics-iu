## Let $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n \sim_{iid} N(\theta, \sigma^2)$ where $\sigma^2$ is known. Consider $H_0: \theta \in \Omega_0$ vs $H_1: \theta \in \Omega_1$ where

\[ \Omega_0 = (-\infty, \theta_0], \quad \Omega_1 = (\theta_0, \infty), \quad \Omega = (-\infty, \infty) = \Omega_0 \cup \Omega_1 \]

\
\

## 1. Write down the joint distribution $f(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ and likelihood function $L(\theta)$.

\[
  \boxed{= \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \right)^n e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \theta)^2}}
\]

The two equations have the same form, but the unknowns are not the same. For the joint distribution, the y values have not yet been observed and are unknown. On the other hand, the joint distribution 
$\textit{becomes}$ the likelihood function once these y values have been observed and the value of $\theta$ is the primary unknown of the equation.

\
\

## 2. Given that the MLE is
\[ \hat{\theta} = \bar{y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i, \]

## then what is the $max_{\theta \in \Omega}L(\theta)$?

\[
\begin{aligned}
  maxL(\theta) = L(\bar{y}) = \boxed{\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \right)^n e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
\end{aligned}
\]

\
\

## 3. Under $H_0: \theta \leq \theta_0$, the restricted MLE is
\[
\hat{\theta_R} = 
\begin{cases}
  \bar{y}, &\bar{y} \leq \theta_0 \\
  \theta_0, &\bar{y} > \theta_0 \\
\end{cases}
\]

## then what is $max_{\theta \in \Omega_0}L(\theta)$?

\[
\begin{aligned}
max_{H_0}L(\theta) = L(\theta_0) &= 
  \begin{cases}
    \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \right)^n e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}, \quad \bar{y} \leq \theta_0 \\
    \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \right)^n e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \theta_0)^2}, \quad \bar{y} > \theta_0 \\
  \end{cases}
  \\
  &= \boxed{\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \right)^n e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \theta_0)^2}}
\end{aligned}
\]

We can dismiss the case where $bar{y}$ is less than $\theta_0$ because the case invalidates our likelihood comparison in the first place. If ever $\bar{y}$ is less than $\theta_0$, your ratio evaluates to one, a value you will never reject. Hence, the only hypotheses worth evaluating are those that underestimate $\bar{y}$

\
\

## 4. The likelihood ratio test statistic is 
\[
  \lambda(y_1,\dots,y_n) = \frac{ max_{\theta \in \Omega_0}L(\theta) }{max_{\theta \in \Omega}L(\theta) }
\]

## Obtain this likelihood ratio test statistic.

\
\

## 5. The likelihood ratio test procedure is that we will reject $H_0$ if $\lambda(y_1,\dots,y_n) \leq k$, where $k < 1$. Explain that this is equivalent to $z \geq \sqrt{-2logk}$, where
\[ z = \frac{\bar{y} - \theta_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \]

\
\

## 6. Why must k < 1?

One can tell that the value for comparison, k, must be less than 1 simply by understanding the terms in the ratio it is compared with. The denominator of $\lambda(y_1, \dots, y_n)$ is $max_{\theta \in \Omega}L(\theta)$. This term represents the global maximum of the likelihood with no restriction on the values that $\theta$ can take. The numerator of $\lambda(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ is the maximum of the same likelihood function, but with a restriction on the values that $\theta$ can take. It therefore follows that the value numerator will be less than that of the denominator, leading to a value wherein k < 1.

## 7. (Optional) Derive both MLE $\hat{\theta}$ and restricted MLE $\hat{\theta_R}$.
